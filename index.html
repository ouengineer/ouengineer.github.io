        <h3><a id="welcome" class="anchor" href="#welcome" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hi, I'm Matthew Thomas...</h3>

        <p>I'm an Austin-based entrepreneur.  I've spent most of my career working in start-ups with a particular focus on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23edtech">#EdTech</a> SaaS companies.
        Most recently I co-founded <a href="https://www.blackbaud.com/solutions/grant-and-award-management/award-management">AcademicWorks</a>, which provides cloud-based software to help colleges, universities, and community foundations manage their scholarship processes while increasing donor engagement.
        We help ensure that these institutions use all their scholarship funds while honoring their donors' wishes.
        That's a fancy way of saying that we help encourage the virtuous cycle ensuring that scholarship dollars are used to help kids pay for college while recognizing the donors for their impact and contribution so that they and their friends will be inclined to help more students.</p>

        <p>In April 2017, <a href="https://www.blackbaud.com/solutions/grant-and-award-management/award-management">AcademicWorks</a> was acquired by <a href="https://www.blackbaud.com">Blackbaud (NASDAQ: BLKB)</a>.</p>

        <p>Outside of entrepreneurial endeavors, you'll usually find me running around <a href="http://www.thetrailfoundation.org/">Lady Bird Lake</a> or fighting my way through a <a href="http://www.beattheblerch.com/">marathon with Nutella</a> to make up for the <a href="http://www.themadfermentationist.com/">homebrew</a> I just finished.
        You're also likely see me at an <a href="https://www.eonetwork.org/austin">Entrepreneurs' Organization</a> event, which always seems to be filled with really fantastic and inspiring people.</p>

        <h3><a id="contact" class="anchor" href="#contact" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contact</h3>

        <p>I enjoy ideation and commiserating with fellow start-up folks, whether that be sharing war stories or serving as an advisor to a burgeoning new company.
        If you think I can be of assistance, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rmatthewthomas">look me up</a> and drop me a line, or stop in and see me at my Entrepreneur-in-Residence office hours at <a href="https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/Centers/Kelleher-Center/About-Us/EIR">The Herb Kelleher Center for Entrepreneurship</a>.
